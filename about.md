You are on [the personal blog of me, discretegames](https://discretegames.github.io/).
All the posts here are written by me about various little or big projects I do, usually involving computer science and
software development.

## About Me

I am discretegames, just a guy online who prefers to remain
[discreet](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/discreet-discrete-definitions-examples),
so you won't see a lot of personal info here.

My username "discretegames" encompasses many of my interests and is part-acronym:

- Discrete (non-continuous) things like [discrete math](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_mathematics) and
[pixels](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/203621/generate-green-spray-paint-patterns).
- G for Games: I won the [PyWeek 31](https://pyweek.org/31/) game jam with my solo entry
[Python Prison](https://pyweek.org/e/pythonprison/).
- A for Art: I've [drawn and animated many emotes](https://www.behance.net/discretegames) and related art.
- M for Math: I made [a Python library for working with hypercomplex numbers](https://pypi.org/project/hypercomplex/).
- E for Engineering: I've made many
[K'NEX contraptions](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-3f_6STTSZk5yoCS3UC1Tw/videos),
including a [4-bit adder](https://youtu.be/1mxZ6jJ6iic).
- S for (Computer) Science: I love programming and
[theoretical computer science](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/480162150225018891/868254314488016937/Complexity_Classes_v2.png).

[My logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/discretegames/discretegames.github.io/main/assets/logo.png) is a
[NAND logic gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAND_gate) shaped like a D inside a stylized G:

NAND is awesome because it can be used to make [entire](https://nandgame.com/),
[functioning](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) computers.
