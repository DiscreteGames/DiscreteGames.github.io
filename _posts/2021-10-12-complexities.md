The image above is a portion of an infographic I made recently on
[computational complexities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity_theory) and their
[classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity_class),
which is the topic at the foundation of things like [big O notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation)
and the unsolved [P vs. NP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_versus_NP_problem)
[Millennium Prize problem](https://www.claymath.org/millennium-problems).

Here is the full infographic, available as a [PNG](/assets/complexities/complexity_classes.png),
[PDF](/assets/complexities/complexity_classes.pdf),
or  [SVG](/assets/complexities/complexity_classes.svg)
(also [on GitHub](https://github.com/discretegames/discretegames.github.io/tree/main/assets/complexities)):

Please feel free to use it as an educational resource!

I made it based on the first 50 minutes or so of the truly excellent
[Lecture 1 of MIT 6.890 *Algorithmic Lower Bounds: Fun with Hardness Proofs*](https://youtu.be/7d73E1DiH0w) from Fall 2014
with instructor [Erik Demaine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_Demaine) where he draws the same diagram:

The [entire course](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-890-algorithmic-lower-bounds-fun-with-hardness-proofs-fall-2014/index.htm)
is available freely online, as are [many other MIT courses](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/most-visited-courses/),
including [6.006 *Introduction to Algorithms*](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP61Oq3tWYp6V_F-5jb5L2iHb)
from Fall 2011 which I have watched every lecture of and strongly recommend!
(Though [the 2020 version](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-spring-2020/) is probably more up to date.)
