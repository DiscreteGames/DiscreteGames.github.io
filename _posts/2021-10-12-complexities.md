The image above is a portion of an infographic I made recently on
computational complexity classes,
which is the topic at the foundation of things like big O notation
and the P vs. NP [Millennium Prize problem](https://www.claymath.org/millennium-problems)
that [you can win $1,000,000 for solving](https://www.claymath.org/sites/default/files/millennium_prize_rules_0.pdf).

It shows the relation between common complexity classes such as P
(problems that are solvable in polynomial time as the size of the input grows) or
EXP (problems that are solvable in exponential time as the size of the input grows)
in a way I find much more clear than
[the usual bubble diagram](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Complexity_subsets_pspace.svg#/media/File:Complexity_subsets_pspace.svg).

Here is the full infographic, available as a [PNG](/assets/complexities/complexity_classes.png),
[PDF](/assets/complexities/complexity_classes.pdf),
or  [SVG](/assets/complexities/complexity_classes.svg)
(also [on GitHub](https://github.com/discretegames/discretegames.github.io/tree/main/assets/complexities)):

Please feel free to use it as an educational resource.

I made it based on the first 50 minutes or so of the truly excellent
[Lecture 1 of MIT 6.890 *Algorithmic Lower Bounds: Fun with Hardness Proofs*](https://youtu.be/7d73E1DiH0w) from Fall 2014
with instructor [Erik Demaine](http://erikdemaine.org/) where he draws the same diagram:

The [entire course is available freely online](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-890-algorithmic-lower-bounds-fun-with-hardness-proofs-fall-2014/index.htm),
as are [many other MIT courses](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/most-visited-courses/),
including [6.006 *Introduction to Algorithms*](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP61Oq3tWYp6V_F-5jb5L2iHb)
from Fall 2011 which I have watched every lecture of and strongly recommend.
(Though [the 2020 version](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-spring-2020/) is probably more up to date.)
